            <p>
                Hi, my name is Nowshin Sharmin. At Metropolitan University, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in
                computer
                science and engineering. I've taken part in numerous programming contests. Among them are the Ada
                Lovelace
                National Girls' Programming Contest 2022 (my team name was <span
                    class="highlight">"MU_Shopno_Bilashi"</span>)
                and the National Girls' Programming Contest 2022 (held at Daffodil University). Most recently, I took
                part
                in the BUET Inter University Programming Contest 2023 (my team name was <span
                    class="highlight">"MU_Aspirants"</span>).

                    I am the master of html, css and javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular javascript framework called
                    vue js.

                    I am presently in learning stage. I hope someday, I will become a good developer. I am currently
                    studying CSE. My graduation will be completed in 2024.
